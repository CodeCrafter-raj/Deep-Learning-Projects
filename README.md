Title of the Project:- Herbal plant leaves classification using Deep Learning Models

The project utilized the medicinal plant leaves dataset sourced from Kaggle. Due to the limited number of images, data augmentation techniques were employed.
There were 53 classes in total, each containing 300 images.
A self-defined CNN architecture was developed for image classification. Additionally, four transfer learning models were utilized: RESNET50, VGG19, VGG16, and InceptionV3. 
The transfer learning models achieved an accuracy of 99%, while the self-defined CNN architecture achieved 95% accuracy.
